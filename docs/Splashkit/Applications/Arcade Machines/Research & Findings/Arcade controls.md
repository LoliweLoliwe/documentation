## About Controls

Two `joysticks` and `buttons` are controls found on the deck of the arcade machine. Specifically, there are nine (9) `buttons` on the deck. Six of these are positioned on the right side of each of the `joysticks` (**JS**), marked with letters A to F. Lastly, the `start` button at the top-centre of the deck with the `player 1` and `player 2` buttons at the left and right-hand side of it. See the UI mockup below.
